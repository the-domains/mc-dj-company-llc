> Carmen was absolutely indispensable to us. After we've experienced his service, my husband and I believe that nobody should get married without him!
> 
> Carmen helped me plan our wedding by meeting with my husband and I several times to set a timeline for the big day. Not only was he interested in setting up a timeline that would flow, but he assured that it was tailored specifically to OUR liking.
> 
> He coordinated by phone and email to assure that he knew the ins and outs of what we pictures our big day to look like, while giving us advice and guidance to assure that it would run smoothly.
> 
> Carmen helped us to select ceremony music, and also gave our guests a super cool link for requesting songs to be played at our reception! This was a huge hit with the family.
> 
> Most importantly, Carmen was the MC AND the DJ to our wedding reception. Not only did he make all of the announcements, but he printed and distributed timelines to all of our vendors so that everyone was on the same page. He checked in with my husband and I periodically and made sure we knew what we needed to do next! It was so comforting to have him and we would have been a nervous wreck without his guidance.
> 
> Once the dance floor opened up, Carmen kept everyone on it! We had so much fun and our guests never stopped dancing.  
> We would HIGHLY recommend MCDJ company to anyone who is getting married! Outstanding service and a very professional, personable guy.
